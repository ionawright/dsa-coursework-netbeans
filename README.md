# Data Structures & Algorithms Coursework


### 🤔What is this app? 
Represent students in a university registration system and a data structure to hold a collection of students.

- Implement IDisplayable Interface
- Build a student class
- Build a student list class
- Read / write data from / to a file 
- Pull the parts altogether
_______

### 🛠Get it working:

##### 1. Download / clone the repo to your local machine
##### 2. Open up Netbeans 8.2 and find the files you just downloaded
##### 3. Run the application and you should see `"Hello, welcome to the student registration application"`
##### 4. Use the supplied menu to work with the database

### 👩‍💻Need to further develop:
- I never implemented the IDisplayable interface - unsure exactly what I could use this for or am I over thinking this? 💭
- I can only store a file via the Object stream, still working out how to import a file 🤦🏼‍♀️ 
- I need to look up JavaDocs, unsure what the benefit of this is yet 🤷‍♀️

Still writing 💬
